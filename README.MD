## GUI-based Server Manager

This is a template project for easy control of remote personal computers/servers/workstations via a graphical interface based on the ASP.NET **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** web server. Designed to log in with the local machine account and a custom password generated by the user when running the program, which remains hidden in memory, it is currently possible to send operating system terminal commands and capture responses **(interactive support not yet available).** In the future, it will also be possible to access and add/view and delete files from the logged-in user and the system (if administrator).

**Designed to run on a local account (not as a pre-login process or system service). Permission limitations are assigned to the local user running the web server.**

> Access and control the remote machine with less bureaucratic infrastructure.

### Key Features

- `--Command line` for login attempts and IP bans.
- Local user login with identity authentication 
`CookieAuthenticationDefaults`.
- Stacking the password created with `SecureString` (security layer).
- Error handling with error screen (anonymous and authenticated variants).
- Security layer basics (The highest level is restricting non-administrator users who run this web server).
- Executes system terminal commands, inspects search box search.
- Localization through pages (English, Chinese, Russian). `AppResources.resx`
- [Bootstrap](https://bootswatch.com/spacelab/#top) and basic integration in js.

### Tech Stack

- Language: C# (target .NET `8.0`)
- Framework: `ASP.NET Core MVC`
---
### Prerequisites
- [.NET SDK `8.0` or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```
---
#### NuGet Packages
- `System.CommandLine`
  
Use `dotnet restore` to recover the packages.

---
### Usage
`..` When you start the program, the terminal will be blank, displaying only `..` This means that it is waiting for the user to enter a password to create the Web App password than press ENTER. The characters are not displayed on the terminal to prevent them from being exploited in memory.

`--login_attempts 5` Maximum login attempts per IP address within a given time interval.

`--time_out 90` IP ban time after exhausting login attempts (in seconds).

`--sess-time_out 360` Time before the user session expires (in seconds).

---
### Local Setup
Change the server's IP and port by modifying the “`Url`” Kestrel keys in `appsettings.json`.

    "Kestrel": {
      "Endpoints": {
        "Http": {
          "Url": "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
        },
        "Https": {
          "Url": "https://127.0.0.1:5001"
        }
      }
    }
